        <h3>Problem:</h3>
        <p>
          Zoja Golubeva is a professional artist based in Latvia. Zoja considers art her lifestyle business and her
          various artworks as different ways of her self-expression. Besides painting and drawing, which are her main
          areas, she creates masterpieces with the use of unconventional materials like paper, plastic, metal, textile,
          and more. She also designs and builds installations for various occasions and has won awards for her
          creations.
          <br>
          <br>
          Besides being an artist, Zoja is also working in the field of marketing, therefore has very limited time for
          promoting her art pieces. She has a professional portfolio showcasing some of her artistic works, but it has
          not been updated since 2015. Since then, she has produced a lot more artworks and has evolved as an artist,
          therefore she needs an online presence that reflects this growth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="proj-text">
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>
          Solution consists of a new portfolio website that represents Zoja as a developed artist, as well as showcases
          her works in a professional manner. One of the focuses for this project was keeping everything clean and
          appealing, as the portfolio would be used with the intention of getting exhibition curators interested in
          displaying Zoja's works.

        <h3>User research:</h3>
        <p>
          For User research qualitative interviews and benchmarking were used as main information gathering methods.
          Potential user group representatives were inteviewed about their attitudes and behaviours towards art. During
          the benchmarking process artist protfolio standarts were identified and later used in the interface design
          process.

        <h3>Project management:</h3>
        <p>
          As a project manager, my main tasks were:
        <ul>
          <li>Organization of weekly meetings</li>
          <li>Quality control</li>
          <li>Ensuring that the project is progressing within the scope of the assignment and the clients expectations
          </li>
          <li>Organization of time schedule and the task board</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="proj-text">
        <h3>Technical realization:</h3>
        <p>
          As the amount of works would be unwise to keep as static images in the project's assets, we chose Wordpress
          headless CMS for that particular task. The artworks then were called through RESTful API calls to display
          dynamically. The images were optimized in order to shorten the load time.
          <br>
          Github was used for version control. The website is realized though HTML, CSS and Javascript.
